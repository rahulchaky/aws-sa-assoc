# 1. Course Fundamentals and AWS Accounts

## 1.1 AWS Accounts - The Basics
### AWS Accounts
- An AWS Account is a container for identities(users) and Resources.
    - An AWS account contains users which you login with, and resources, which you provision.
    - The Account ROOT USER has full control over all of THIS AWS ACCOUNT and any resources created within it AND can't be restricted.
### IAM
- Identity and Access Management (IAM) Users, Groups, and Roles can also be created and given FULL or LIMITED permissions.
    - Any IAM identity starts with no permissions.
### AWS Account Security
- AWS Accounts can contain the impact of admin errors, or exploits by bad actors.
    - Ideally, you would use separate accounts for separate things (DEV, TEST, PROD).
- By default all access to an AWS Account is denied except for the Account Root User.

## 1.2 Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)
- Without MFA a static username and an infrequently changing password are needed to login.
- MFA device/app generates a code every 30 seconds. This code is needed together with username and password.
- AWS generates Secret Key and additional information (user, etc.).
- QR Code is generated based on the secret key and additional information.
- QR Code is scanned, which adds key and info within app.
- Now, even if username and password are leaked, you need to still provide MFA code to login.
